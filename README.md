# data-nasa-gov-frontpage
A frontpage for data.nasa.gov before traffic gets redirected to socrata's pages

## CURRENTLY A DRAFT IS RUNNING LIVE ON https://developer.nasa.gov/pages/OpenInnovation/data-nasa-gov-frontpage/#


## Goals for project
### Shoulds
- Make it obvious that you should click through to the catalog 
- Let users know about other resources
  - open.nasa.gov
  - code.nasa.gov
  - api.nasa.gov
  - etc????
- Look like other sites
  - especially the catalog & open.nasa.gov?
  - other NASA sites
- Should reuse nasa webdesign service: https://nasa.github.io/nasawds-site/

### Haves
- Links to other open-innovation sites
- standard/reusable footers
- standard/reusable  headers

### Should not
- require a lot to maintain
- be confusing about where people are or where they are going

### Ideally
- meet the informational needs of a wide variety of users in less than 2 seconds or 10 seconds
- Include components that are reusable! Especially on api.nasa.gov and maybe open.nasa.gov as we redo those. Maybe code.nasa.gov too?
