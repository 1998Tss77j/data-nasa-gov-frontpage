# data-nasa-gov-frontpage

Data.nasa.gov holds metadata harvested from more than 88 different NASA sites that share public data.

This front-end only page serves as an easy to change front-page for the system that hosts the catalog of datasets in data.nasa.gov (which is not on github).

## Potentially Reusable Code Assets Leveraged by this Repository

This page uses nasawds-2.0.7, which you can find here: https://github.com/nasa/nasawds which is based on GSA's <a href="https://github.com/uswds/uswds"> US web design service</a>. Both are open-source projects on Github.

The <a href="https://github.com/nasa/data-nasa-gov-frontpage/tree/master/non-nasawds-assets/footer">footer</a> is reused across several open-innovation pages.
