# data-nasa-gov-frontpage
A frontpage for data.nasa.gov before traffic gets redirected to socrata's pages. Currently, the frontpage is generated by socrata instead. To have direct control over it and be able to change things, we'll need to create this githubpages page and then let socrata know where it is. We might also have to get an URL assigned to this page, not sure on that part yet...

## Goals for project
### Shoulds
- Make it obvious that you should click through to the catalog 
- Let users know about other resources
  - open.nasa.gov
  - code.nasa.gov
  - api.nasa.gov
  - etc????
- Look like other sites
  - especially the catalog & open.nasa.gov?
  - other NASA sites
- Should reuse nasa webdesign service: https://nasa.github.io/nasawds-site/

### Haves
- Links to other open-innovation sites
- standard/reusable footers
- standard/reusable  headers

### Should not
- require a lot to maintain
- be confusing about where people are or where they are going

### Ideally
- meet the informational needs of a wide variety of users in less than 2 seconds or 10 seconds
- Include components that are reusable! Especially on api.nasa.gov and maybe open.nasa.gov as we redo those. Maybe code.nasa.gov too?
